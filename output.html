<p>I star
    ted as an intern and stayed on as a full-time employee at a company where w=
    e built
    custom Ma=
    gento 2 shops for clients of all sizes and industries. Wteam with a
    designer and back-end developer, where my tas=
    k was to replicate designs to
    working shops with (p)HTML, SCSS, jQuery,
    KnockoutJS, and PHP=
    when needed. Some of the
    recent shops that I helped deliver include
    QH=
    P Vedder Vedder Alcomex and many
    more.

    In-house multinational company which
    provides multiple=
    SaaS solutions. I started by helping
    to set up a React project, which was my
    first experie=
    nce with React. Later on, I insisted on
    rebuilding the entire f=
    ront-end of the main shop due to legacy CSS and lack of semantic
    HTML. I scraped every line=
    and rebuilt feature by feature in tight collaboration with the
    designer and back-end devel=
    opers, who used C#/.NET. The front-end consisted of my own
    (open source) SCSS boilerplate,=
    vanilla JS, and KnockoutJS. It is still a work in progress and in-
    house code, but I'd lov=
    e to share some.<a href="https://shopreworkstaticnojs.netlify.app/" target="_blank"> snapshots</a>.</p>
